# LinqPerf

Initially it was an app for checking linq performance. But later I added more collections. Made for presentation and training purposes.
I know that [Benchmark .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet) is better for measurment but it takes a time to processes everything. And also I wanted to show some charts quickly.
